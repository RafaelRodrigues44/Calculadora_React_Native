# React Native Calculator App

## Description
This repository contains a simple calculator application developed in React Native. The calculator provides an intuitive interface with buttons for numbers, operators, and special functionalities.

## Main Components
### Calculator
The `Calculator` component serves as the core of the application, handling the logic behind the calculator. It features a display area for the current expression and interactive buttons for entering numbers and operations. The code is structured to accommodate various mathematical operations, including clearing, percentage calculation, and square root.

### Box

The `TextArea` component is responsible for displaying the current expression of the calculator in a text area, providing a clear representation of user input and the resulting expression.

## Styles
Styles have been defined using the React Native StyleSheet library. Adjustments to colors, font sizes, and layout ensure a visually pleasing experience.
